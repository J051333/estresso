# Estresso

Estresso is a library for implementing estradiol blood level estimation in Java/Kotlin.
The underlying pharmacokinetics information is based off of [Estrannaise.js](https://github.com/WHSAH/estrannaise.js) (not affiliated).
Essentially a port of the fundamental parts of estrannaise.js to Kotlin, Estresso allows for the simulation of
estradiol blood levels in Java and Android applications. 

As with estrannaise.js, Estresso is not guaranteed to be accurate. It serves to give a ballpark-estimate, primarily to 
gauge the relative amount of estrogen in the body for trans-fem and others taking feminizing HRT. Please do not make
medical decisions based off Estresso's information as it is no replacement or stand-in for hormone level blood tests.
